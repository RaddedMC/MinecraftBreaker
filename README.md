# MinecraftBreaker  
A simple Minecraft-themed brick breaker game I made while learning how to use Unity.  
  
Made in Unity 2020.3.0f1 Personal  
Learned at https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse with the help of GameDev TV!  
I don't own the rights to Minecraft or any of its images. I'm simply a fan of the game who used it as a theme for my block breaker game!  
Sound effects made with bfxr. https://www.bfxr.net/
